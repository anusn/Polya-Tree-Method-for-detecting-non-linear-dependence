# Polya-Tree-Method-for-detecting-non-linear-dependence

Here I'm uploading a computationally efficient function I developed for calculating logged Bayes Factors for testing dependence using the method described in the following article: https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ba/1474463236

There is also a second function that can be used when the data seems to be zero-inflated (i.e. when it has many zeros).

Currently an R package is in the process of being developed to provide more functionality.
